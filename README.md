# 🎯 EventEase — Smart Event Management & Routing System (C DSA Project)

**EventEase** is a command-line Event Management System built using **C programming and Data Structures & Algorithms**. Designed to simplify the event venue selection process for users in **Belagavi**, the system allows for efficient hall discovery, booking, and optimal travel routing between event locations using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**.

This project was developed as part of the academic curriculum under the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** course to demonstrate real-world applications of core DSA concepts.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🔎 **Venue Discovery**: Search and list available event venues with details such as location, capacity, amenities, and rental price.
- 🧠 **Shortest Route Finder**: Uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the optimal path between any two cities or localities in the network.
- 🧾 **Event Log Management**: Users can record and review booked events for tracking and history.
- 🧮 **DSA Concepts in Action**: Implements hashing, file I/O, arrays, structs, and graph algorithms efficiently.
- 🧵 **Persistent Storage**: All venue data, routes, and event logs are stored and accessed from external `.txt` files.
